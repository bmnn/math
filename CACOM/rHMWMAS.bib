	abstract={In this paper experiments with acceleration sensors are described for human activity recognition of a wearable device user. The use of principal component analysis and independent component analysis with a wavelet transform is tested for feature generation. Recognition of human activity is examined with a multilayer perceptron classifier. Best classification results for recognition of different human motion were 83-90\%, and they were achieved by utilizing independent component analysis and principal component analysis. The difference between these methods turned out to be negligible},
