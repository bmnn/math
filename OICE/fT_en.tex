Given a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ and a vector $c \in \mathbb{R}^n$, exactly one of the following two system of equations and inequalities has a solution:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\exists x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ with $A x \leq 0$ and $c^T x > 0$
    \item $\exists y \in \mathbb{R}^m$ with $A^T y = c$ and $y \geq 0$
  \end{enumerate}
